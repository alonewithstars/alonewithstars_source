![Good Bye](Bye.png)
I took a picture of the lonely railway platform that lay opposite to us. I quickly typed "bye" and sent the snap to the people I loved. I quietly put an Instagram story of the same snap. I was bidding farewell to a city I had lived for four years. Maybe this was the feeling of growing up. I realised I was about to become a migratory species moving from city to city. No, I had already become one when I came to this city. The city, whose traffic and streets I disliked, but it did gift me with many beautiful sunsets and souls that I will cherish forever. But, forever had already lost its meaning. 

The train departed. I waved at them as they disappeared slowly.
I crawled up to the upper-berth to get some sleep (and to shed a few years). As I opened my eyes, I could hear the rain rattling against the window. Cold. I slowly went outside and stood against the door. I tried to capture the essence of the greenery that spread in front of me. Last time. I had already done many last times with or without the realisation. And I knew what lay in front of me, infinite last times and infinite good-byes.

PS: I want to list the million things that I am missing right now, but do not have the energy/ emotional capacity to do so.
